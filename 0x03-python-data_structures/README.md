# 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples
This project touches extensively in data structures and algorithms concepts. Mainly lists and tuples
# Lists 
These are one of the compound data types in python, used to group together other values. Lists can be written as comma-separated values(items) between square brackets. They may contain different data types in them, but usually the items all have same type.
~ Lists supports operation like concatenation.
~ unlike strings lists are immutable.
~ Lists operations:
	* list.append() = adds an item at the end of the list != a[len(a):] = [x]
	* list.extent() = appends all the items from the iterable != a[len(a):]=iterable.
	* list.insert(i, x) = inserts an item at a given position. i is the position and x is the item.
	* list.remove(x) = removes an item.
	* list.pop([i])
	* list.clear()
	* list.index() and many more
* main difference between a list and a tuple is that tuples are immutable(can not be changed)
