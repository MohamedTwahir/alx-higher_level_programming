# 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions
This directory contains solutions i came up with for the tasks in the above project issued by Alx in my software engineering journey.
# Tasks
* Task 0
I was to create a program that will assign whether a number is zero, negative or positive when randomly generate by the help of a random module.
The output of the program should be:
	* The number followed by:
		* if the  number is greater than 0: is positive
		* if the number is 0: is zero
		* if the number is less than 0: is negative
	* followed by a new line
* Task 1
Program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number.
