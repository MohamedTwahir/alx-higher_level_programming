# 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects
I have had experience in procedure-oriented way of programming from the start of this repository. But in this directory i will be learning another way of organizing my program which is called Object Oriented Programming(OOP) paradigm. Object oriented programming is simply a way of combining data and functionality and wrapping it into something called an object.It is a useful concept especially when writing large programs or a problem best suited in search method.
# Classes and Objects
A class creates a new type where objects are instances of the class. For instance we have a variable of type int. This means variables that store integers are variables which are instances of the int class.
Objects can store data using ordinary variables that belong to the object. Variables belonging to an object are called fields. Objects can also have functionality by using functions that belong to a class. Such functions are called methods of the class.
